# Logging Standard

- Use `structlog` with JSON output. No `print()` statements anywhere in `src/`.
- Every prediction request must log:
  - Timestamp
  - Input features (hashed, not raw values, for privacy)
  - Prediction result
  - Inference time in milliseconds
- App startup must log: model path loaded, model version, app version.
- Use log levels appropriately: INFO for requests, WARNING for degraded responses, ERROR for failures.
