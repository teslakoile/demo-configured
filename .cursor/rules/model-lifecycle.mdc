# Model Lifecycle

- Model must be loaded once at app startup via FastAPI lifespan context manager.
- Never load or train the model inside a request handler.
- Model artifacts are saved to `models/` directory.
- Training script: `src/train.py`. Must use a fixed random seed for reproducibility.
- The training script must emit evaluation metrics (accuracy, classification report) via structured logs (JSON output to stdout is acceptable).
- The training script must save the model using joblib.
