# Documentation Style

## Python
- Every module must have a module-level docstring.
- Docstrings must follow Google style.
- No docstring on obvious one-liner helper functions.

## README.md
Scaffold/demo README files are exempt. Apply this section to the application README that ships with the implemented service.

Must include these sections in order:
1. Project overview (one paragraph)
2. Setup instructions (using uv)
3. Training the model
4. Running the API
5. API endpoint table with example curl commands
6. Running tests
