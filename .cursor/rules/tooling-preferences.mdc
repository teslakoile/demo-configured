# Tooling Preferences

- Use `uv` for all dependency and environment management.
  - `uv sync` to install dependencies.
  - `uv run <command>` to run scripts.
  - `uv add <package>` to add dependencies.
- For new Python work, create `.python-version` with `3.11` and create `pyproject.toml` before installing dependencies.
- All project metadata goes in `pyproject.toml`. No `setup.py`, no `setup.cfg`, no `requirements.txt`.
- Use `ruff` for linting and formatting. Config is in `pyproject.toml`.
- Never use `pip install` directly.
